# UiTestAngular

The acceptance criteria was accomplished.
- I used localStorage to persist the data. 
- To reset the data just remove the 'RULINGS_DATA' key on the browser > application > local storage
- for the tablet and mobile versions (responsive) i've only worked with 992px and 684px sizes, so there could be some misaligned components if checked with some other sizes
- haven't added any additional task (server or unit tests), mainly focused on the design and responsiveness.
- i've tried to follow some order on the commits
